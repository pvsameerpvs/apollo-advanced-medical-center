Scaling and polishing is a professional dental cleaning that helps remove plaque and tartar build-up. It supports healthy gums, reduces bad breath, and helps prevent cavities.

## Why it matters

- **Gum health:** Tartar can irritate gums and lead to gingivitis.
- **Cleaner smile:** Removes surface stains to brighten teeth.
- **Prevention:** Reduces the risk of more complex dental problems.

## The process

1. Oral assessment
2. Scaling to remove tartar
3. Polishing for a smooth finish
4. Aftercare guidance

## Who it’s for

Most adults benefit from regular cleaning. If you have sensitive gums or dental work, your dentist will tailor the approach.
