Laser hair removal is one of the most popular treatments for long-term hair reduction. When performed by trained, DHA-licensed therapists with medical-grade protocols, it can be a safe and comfortable option for face and body.

## Key benefits

- **Long-term reduction:** Hair grows back finer and slower over time.
- **Smoother skin:** Helps reduce irritation caused by shaving and waxing.
- **Less ingrown hair:** With proper aftercare, many clients notice fewer ingrown hairs.
- **Fast sessions:** Treat small areas quickly, or plan full-body packages.

## What to expect during treatment

1. **Consultation** to confirm suitability and plan areas.
2. **Customized settings** based on skin type and hair characteristics.
3. **Session** with comfort checks and protective steps.
4. **Aftercare** for 24–48 hours and recommended intervals.

## Who it’s best for

Laser hair removal suits many skin types and concerns. If you have a history of skin sensitivity, recent tanning, or specific medical conditions, a consultation ensures a safe plan.

## Aftercare basics

- Avoid heat exposure (sauna/steam) for 24–48 hours.
- Use gentle skincare and SPF.
- Follow your therapist’s schedule for best results.
