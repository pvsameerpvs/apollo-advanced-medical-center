Glowing skin usually comes from a combination of hydration, gentle exfoliation, and consistent aftercare. The best facial is the one that matches your skin’s current needs.

## Popular choices

- **Deep Cleansing Facial:** Great for clogged pores and congested skin.
- **Hydrafacial:** Combines cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, and hydration.
- **Hydration & Glow Facial:** Focuses on moisture and barrier support.

## How to choose

- If you’re oily or prone to breakouts, start with **deep cleansing**.
- If you’re dull or dehydrated, consider **hydrafacial** or **hydration-focused** facials.
- If you’re unsure, a **skin analysis** is the quickest way to avoid trial-and-error.

## Aftercare that protects results

- Use gentle cleanser and moisturizer.
- Wear sunscreen daily.
- Avoid harsh actives for 24–48 hours after a facial.
