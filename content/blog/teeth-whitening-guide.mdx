Teeth whitening can brighten your smile quickly, but the safest results come from professional assessment and the right technique for your teeth and gums.

## Whitening options

- **In-clinic whitening:** Faster results under professional supervision.
- **Take-home trays:** Gradual whitening with a customized plan.

## Safety first

- Whitening is best after a dental check and cleaning.
- Existing fillings/crowns may not change color, so planning matters.

## Maintaining results

- Limit staining foods and drinks.
- Keep regular cleanings.
- Follow your dentist’s recommended schedule.
