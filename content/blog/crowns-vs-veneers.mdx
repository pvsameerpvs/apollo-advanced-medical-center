Crowns and veneers both improve how teeth look, but they serve different needs.

## Veneers

Veneers are thin shells that bond to the front surface of a tooth. They are often used for:

- Minor shape corrections
- Covering discoloration
- Closing small gaps

## Crowns

Crowns cover most or all of a tooth and can be recommended when:

- A tooth is weakened or heavily filled
- There is significant cracking
- After root canal treatment

## How we decide

A consultation helps assess enamel, bite, and long-term stability. The goal is a natural-looking result that supports function.
